My name is Abhishek Srivastava. I currently work as a principal engineer at Research Now in Plano TX.

I love to code in Scala programming platform with focus on Data processing, Analytics, and Natural Language Processing. In my free-time, I also learn about Haskell and Idris programming languages.

This blog is my attempt to record my learnings...
